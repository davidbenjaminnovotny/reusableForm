# Reusable Vue Form


This form was indended to be a reference for future uses and not as a final solution.
It was rather created to be a foundation of concepts which can be used while building a form using the VueJs framework. 

It is still buggy im sure and can be improved greatly, however as previously stated it is only a foundation.

- Still Using Vue 2.0
- Dynamic
- Built in Frontend Validation
- Built in Internationalization 
- No use of external validation Libraries
- Unfortunately no ✨Magic ✨
